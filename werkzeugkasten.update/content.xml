You may add Your own attribution&#xA;          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside&#xA;          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided&#xA;          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed&#xA;          as modifying the License.&#xA;&#xA;      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and&#xA;      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions&#xA;      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or&#xA;      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,&#xA;      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with&#xA;      the conditions stated in this License.&#xA;&#xA;   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade&#xA;      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,&#xA;      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the&#xA;      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.&#xA;&#xA;   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be&#xA;      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a&#xA;      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the&#xA;      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;&#xA;   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing&#xA;      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,&#xA;      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,&#xA;      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this&#xA;      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only&#xA;      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf&#xA;      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,&#xA;      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability&#xA;      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason&#xA;      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.&#xA;&#xA;   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.&#xA;&#xA;      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following&#xA;      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets &quot;[]&quot;&#xA;      replaced with your own identifying information.

If&#xA;You&#xA;institute patent litigation against any entity (including a&#xA;cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work&#xA;or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct&#xA;or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses&#xA;granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate&#xA;as of the date such litigation is filed.&#xA;4.

Unless required by applicable law&#xA;or&#xA;agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each&#xA;Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,&#xA;WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express&#xA;or&#xA;implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions&#xA;of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A&#xA;PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining&#xA;the&#xA;appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume&#xA;any&#xA;risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this&#xA;License.&#xA;8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,&#xA;whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,&#xA;unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly&#xA;negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor&#xA;be&#xA;liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,&#xA;incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising&#xA;as a&#xA;result of this License or out of the use or inability to use&#xA;the&#xA;Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,&#xA;work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all&#xA;other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor&#xA;has been advised of the possibility of such damages.&#xA;9.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,&#xA;      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work&#xA;      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of&#xA;      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.&#xA;      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify&#xA;      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed&#xA;      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.&#xA;&#xA;   6.
