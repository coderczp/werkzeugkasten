# Introduction #

mvnhack is executable jar with no dependency.


mvnhack can download libraries from maven2 repositories without maven2.


download mvnhack [here](http://werkzeugkasten.googlecode.com/files/mvnhack-0.0.3.jar)

# Requirements #
JavaSE 6(tested by 1.6.0\_17) or more

# Usage #
```
java -jar mvnhack.jar [groupId] [artifactId] [version] flat=[on/off] dest=[path]
```

  * groupId
    * if groupId and artifactId has same id, you skip this.
  * artifactId
    * target library's artifactId.
  * version
    * target library's version
  * flat
    * default is **on**.
    * if you want to get own your local repository only. switch to **off**.
  * dest
    * destination directry.
    * default is execution directory.

# Yaml based dependencies #
```
java -jar mvnhack.jar [yml]
```
  * yaml
    * get libraries based on yaml. skip this and current dir contains dependencies.yml then use that file.

# More Options #
## VM Arguments ##
  * proxy
    * Proxy URL. auto detect HTTP or SOCKS proxy.
    * cf. [Networking Properties](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html)
  * repository
    * comma separated maven2 remote/local additional repository URLs.

# Implicit Repositories #
  * if execution directory has directory that name is **repository**, use as local repository.
  * if directory of **user.home** has m2/repository, use it.
  * [maven central repository](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/)

# Examples #
```
java -jar mvnhack-0.0.2.jar commons-httpclient 2.0.2
```
you get commons-httpclient-2.0.2.jar ,commons-logging-1.0.3.jar and some source.jars into execution directory.


in this case,
  * **groupId** is skipped
  * **artifactId** is commons-httpclient
  * **version** is 2.0.2
  * you will be get two kind of artifacts, because commons-httpclient depends commons-logging.



---



```
java -jar mvnhack-0.0.2.jar org.slf4j slf4j-simple 1.4.3 flat=off dest=./foo
```
you get slf4j-simple-1.4.3.jar ,slf4j-api-1.4.3.jar and some source.jars into execution directory.


in this case,
  * **groupId** is org.slf4j
  * **artifactId** is slf4j-simple
  * **version** is 1.4.3
  * **flat** is off
  * **destination** jars are under ./foo with repository structures.
  * you will be get two kind of artifacts, because slf4j-simple depends slf4j-api.

```
java -Dproxy=http://proxy.example.com:8080 -Drepository=http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/maven/, -jar mvnhack-0.0.2.jar commons-httpclient 2.0.2
```
this case, use HTTP proxy access to remote repositories and use addtional repository.

dependencies.yml example.

```
flatten : true
destination : ./lib
proxy : http://proxy.example.com:8080
http.nonProxyHosts : localhost

repositories :
  - http://repository.codehaus.org/
  - https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/

dependencies :
  - org.yaml snakeyaml 1.8
```
this case, override 4 parameters.
  * flatten override flat.
  * destination override dest.
  * proxy and http.nonProxyHosts override JVM environment
and use 2 external repositories.

and define dependency.

dependencies are whitespace separated string sequence contains 2 or 3 value like base usage.
